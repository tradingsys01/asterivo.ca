# AI Chatbot Features - UPGRADED TO CLAUDE API

## ðŸ¤– **Real AI Assistant Powered by Claude**

I've upgraded your chatbot to use Anthropic's Claude API - now it's a truly intelligent AI assistant that can have natural conversations about Asterivo's services!

### **ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:**

**1. Real AI Conversations**
- Powered by Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku model
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Contextual conversations that remember previous messages
- Adaptive responses based on conversation flow

**2. Enhanced Service Knowledge**

### **ðŸ”§ How It Works:**

**Real AI Backend:** Uses Anthropic Claude API with fallback to smart pattern matching
**Natural Conversations:** Ask anything like:
- "I run a small law firm and need help with client intake"
- "What's the difference between your automation tiers?"
- "How would you automate my restaurant's reservation system?"
- "Can you customize a solution for my specific industry?"
- "I'm not sure what I need - can you help me figure it out?"

### **ðŸ’¬ Sample Conversations:**

**User:** "I'm interested but not sure what package is right for me"
**Claude:** "I'd be happy to help you find the perfect fit! Let me ask a few questions to understand your needs better. What kind of business do you run, and what tasks are taking up most of your time each week?"

**User:** "I run a consulting firm and spend hours on proposals and follow-ups"
**Claude:** "Perfect! For consulting firms, I typically recommend starting with our Growth tier ($997/month) which includes automated proposal generation and email sequences. Combined with our Business Day website ($2,497), you'd have a complete system. Most consultants see ROI within 30 days by closing deals 2x faster. Would you like me to explain how the automation would work for your specific proposal process?"
