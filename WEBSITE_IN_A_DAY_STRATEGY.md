# **"Website in a Day" Service Strategy**

## **The Perfect Add-On Service for AI Consultants**

This is brilliant positioning because:
- **Trust builder** → They see immediate results before committing to AI
- **Foot in the door** → Easier sell than complex AI implementations  
- **Upsell pathway** → Website leads naturally to "now let's automate your business"
- **Differentiator** → Most AI consultants can't deliver tangible Day 1 value

## **Common Objections & Responses**

**"Can you really build a good website in one day?"**
> "We've pre-built 80% - the day is for customizing your specific needs. Plus, it's better to launch at 80% perfect today than 100% perfect never."

**"What if I need changes later?"**
> "That's why we include 30 days of updates. Most clients need 2-3 small tweaks max."

**"Why not just use Wix myself?"**
> "You could! But will you? Our clients tried DIY for months. We do it in a day, plus add AI automations Wix can't do."
